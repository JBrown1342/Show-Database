# Show-Database

index.js is the Server. | 
show_database.sql has the artist table information. | 
index.html is the homepage; I am working on configuring it's search request. | 
add_artist.html allows you to add an artist to the database. | 

Now that I understand how to post, I will next create my venue table and connect it.

At that point I feel like I should work on the hompage search request.
I was originally trying to populate a dropdown list on the homepage with the names of all the artist in the database upon loading.
I feel if I can make this connection I will do the same thing for the add show page, where it will be referencing the other tables.
